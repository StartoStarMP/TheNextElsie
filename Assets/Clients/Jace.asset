  clientMissionStrings:
  - missionName: New Place! Need Some Help with It.
    missionDesc: Title says it all. Got a clean new area for myself, and I'm too
      busy doing political stuff now to actually decorate it and all. That's where
      you and a hefty amount of cash come in.
  - missionName: JINKS DESTROYED MY PLACE
    missionDesc: Ok. Jinks completely ruined my place with whatever damn gadgetry
      she cooked up again. Gonna need help fixing it up while I hunt the terrorist
      down.
  - missionName: Safe House Needs Decorating
    missionDesc: So I got moved to a safe house for the moment since I got intel
      that a Zonnite splinter terror group might have their sights set on my place.
      They'll probably torch it, knowing them. Anyway, this current place is a little
      bare. Got some time to help with sprucing it up?
